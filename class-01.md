# HTML and JS

## HTML
* Hypertext Markup Language

#### HTML Uses Elements to Describe the Structure of Pages and each element has an opening tag and closing tag


#### there is two types of html elements:
1. elements that use an opening tag and closing tag.
2. elements that use a self-closing tag.
 
#### A closer look at html tags 
* <p> this called opening tag.
* </p> this called closing tag.
* <a ... /> this called self-closing tag.

#### attributes
* it tell us more about elements and we put it inside the opening tag
* example: <p color = "red"> ahmed </p>
* attributes require a name and a value
 
#### there is two main tags that we should put inside the html tag:
1. body tag <body> </body>
2. head tag <head> </head>


#### the evolution of html:
1. HTML 4 released in 1997.
2. XHTML 1.0 released in  2000.
3. HTML 5 released in  2000.


#### DOCTYPES 
* Because there have been several versions of HTML, each web page should begin with a DOCTYPE declaration to tell a browser which version of HTML the page is using (although browsers usually display the page even if it is not included).


#### comments in html
* there is two ways to type a comment in html:
1. single line comment: we start it with //the comment .
2. multiple line comment: we write it like this <!-- the comment --> .


#### id attribute 
* Every HTML element can carry the id attribute. It is used to uniquely identify that element from other elements on the page. Its value should start with a letter or an underscore (not a number or any other character). It is important that no two elements on the same page have the same value for their id attributes (otherwise the value is no longer unique).


#### class attribute
* Every HTML element can also carry a class attribute. Sometimes, rather than uniquely identifying one element within a document, you will want a way to identify several elements as being different from the other elements on the page.


#### block elements
* Some elements will always appear to start on a new line in the browser window. These are known as block level elements.
* example: <h1> ali </h1>


#### inline elements 
* Some elements will always appear to continue on the same line as their neighbouring elements. These are known as inline elements.
* example: <b> ali </b>

#### grouping text and elements in a block 
* The <div> element allows you to group a set of elements together in one block-level box.

#### grouping text and elements inline
* The <span> element acts like an inline equivalent of the <div> element. It is used to either:
1. Contain a section of text where there is no other suitable element to differentiate it from its surrounding text.
2. Contain a number of inline elements. 


#### iframes 
* An iframe is like a little window that has been cut into your page — and in that window you can see another page. The term iframe is an abbreviation of inline frame.
* One common use of iframes (that you may have seen on various websites) is to embed a Google Map into a page. The content of the iframe can be any html page (either located on the same server or anywhere else on the web).
* the attributes that we should use in iframe tag:
1. src: The src attribute specifies the URL of the page to show in the frame.
2. height: The height attribute specifies the height of the iframe in pixels.
3. width: The width attribute specifiesthe width of the iframe in pixels.


#### scrolling
* t indicates whether the iframe should have scrollbars or not.


#### frameborder
* it indicates whether the frame should have a border or not.


#### seamless
* new attribute called seamless can be applied to an iframe where scrollbars are not desired.


#### meta
* The <meta> element lives inside the <head> element and contains information about that web page.
* It is not visible to users but fulfills a number of purposes such as telling search engines about your page, who created it, and whether or not it is time sensitive. (If the page is time sensitive, it can be set to expire.).
* example: <meta name="description" content="An Essay on Installation Art" />.


#### escape characters
* There are some characters that are used in and reserved by HTML code. (For example, the left and right angled brackets.).


#### HTML 5 layout elements
1. header <header> </header>.
2. footer <footer> </footer>.
3. navigation <nav> </nav>.
4. articles <article> </article>.
5. aside <aside> </aside>.
6. sections <section> </section>.
7. heading groups <hgroup> </hgroup>.
8. figures <figure>  <figcaption> </figcaption>  </figure>.
9. sectioning elements <div>  </div>.
10. Linking Around Block-Level El ements <a> </a>.


### Process and Design

#### Who is the Site For?
* Every website should be designed for the target audience—not just for yourself or the site owner. It is therefore very important to understand who your target audience is.


#### Why People Visit YOUR Website?
* Now that you know who your visitors are, you need to consider why they are coming. While some people will simply chance across your website, most will visit for a specific reason.


#### What Your Visitors are Trying to Achieve?
* It is unlikely that you will be able to list every reason why someone visits your site but you are looking for key tasks and motivations. This information can help guide your site designs.


#### What Information Your Visitors Need?
* You know who is coming to your site and why they are coming, so now you need to work out what information they need in order to achieve their goals quickly and effectively.


#### How Of ten People Will Visit Your Site?
* Some sites benefit from being updated more frequently than others. Some information (such as news) may be constantly changing, while other content remains relatively static.


#### Site Maps
* The aim is to create a diagram of the pages that will be used to structure the site. This is known as a site map and it will show how those pages can be grouped.


#### WireFrames
* A wireframe is a simple sketch of the key information that needs to go on each page of a site. It shows the hierarchy of the information and how much space it might require.


#### Getting your message across using design
* The primary aim of any kind of visual design is to communicate. Organizing and prioritizing information on a page helps users understand its importance and what order to read it in.


#### Visual hierarchy
* Most web users do not read entire pages. Rather, they skim to find information. You can use contrast to create a visual hierarchy that gets across your key message and helps users find what they are looking for.


#### grouping and Similarity
* When making sense of a design, we tend to organize visual elements
into groups. Grouping related pieces of information together can make a design easier to comprehend. Here are some ways this can be achieved.


#### Designing Navigation
* Site navigation not only helps people find where they want to go, but also helps them understand what your site is about and how it is organized. Good navigation tends to follow these principles ..




## JS
* javascript



![javascripts](https://miro.medium.com/max/800/1*bxEkHw1xewxOFjmGunb-Cw.png)



#### you have to learn the basics of scripts and the concepts before you doing the tasks and designing such as :
* what is a scripts and how do i create a one ?
* how do computers fit in the world around them ?
* how do i write a script for a web page ?


#### you can compare scripts through this concepts :
* recipes.
* handbooks.
* manuals.


#### there is a steps for designing scripts :
* remove used bedding .
