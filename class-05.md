# Summarizing

## HTML

#### Images
* There are many reasons why you might want to add an image to a web page: you might want to include a logo, photograph, illustration, diagram, or chart.


##### Chosing images for your site
* A picture can say a thousand words, and great images help make the difference between an average-looking site and a really engaging one.


##### Strong images on your site
* If you are building a site from scratch, it is good practice to create a folder for all of the images the site uses.


##### Adding images
* for this we use (img) tage and we use with it some attributes:
1. src: to adding thr URL of the image.
2. alt: to add some words to apear if the image didnt apear.
3. title: to add a title to the photo.


##### height and width of images
* we use some attributes to control the height and the width of the images:
1. height
2. width


##### where to place images in your code?
* Where an image is placed in the code will affect how it is displayed. Here are three examples of image placement that produce different results:
1. before a paragraph.
2. inside the start of a paragraph.
3. in the middle of a paragraph.


##### Old Code: Aligning Images Horizontally Vertically
* the attribute that we use for this : align, and the values that we use for it:
1. top
2. middle
3. bottom
4. right 
5. left


##### three rules for creating images
1. save images in the right format.
2. save images at the right size.
3. use the correct resolution.


##### Tools to edit and save images 
* There are several tools you can use to edit and save images to ensure that they are the right size, format, and resolution.


##### image formats
1. JPEG
2. GIF


##### image dimensions
* The images you use on your website should be saved at the same width and height that you want them to appear on the page.


##### cropping images
* When cropping images it is important not to lose valuable information. It is best to source images that are the correct shape if possible.


##### image resolution
* Images created for the web should be saved at a resolution of 72 ppi. The higher the resolution of the image, the larger the size of the file.


##### vector images
* Vector images differ from bitmap images and are resolution-independent. Vector images are commonly created in programs such as Adobe Illustrator.


##### animated GIFs
* Animated GIFs show several frames of an image in sequence and therefore can be used to create simple animations.


##### Transparency
* Creating an image that is partially transparent (or "see-through") for the web involves selecting one of two formats:
1. Transparent GIF
2. PNG


#### figure and figure caption
* (figure): Images often come with captions. HTML5 has introduced a new (figure) element to contain images and their caption so that the two are associated.
* The (figcaption) element has been added to HTML5 in order to allow web page authors to add a caption to an image.
