## Layout


##### Building blocks
* CSS treats each HTML element as if it is in its own box. This box will either be a block-level box or an inline box.
* Block-level elements: start on a new line.
* Inline elements: flow in between surrounding text.


##### containing elements
* If one block-level element sits inside another block-level element then the outer box is known as the containing or parent element.


##### controlling the position of elements
* CSS has the following positioning schemes that allow you to control the layout of a page: normal flow, relative positioning, and absolute positioning. You specify the positioning scheme using the position property in CSS.


##### we can float elements using float property:
1. normal flow.
2. realtive positioning.
3. absolute positioning.


##### Box offset
* to indicate where a box should be positioned
* the values that we use for it:
1. fixed positioning 
2. floating positioning


##### z-index
* When you move any element from normal flow, boxes can overlap. The z-index property allows you to control which box appears on top.
