# Summarizing

## CSS

### Images

#### Controlling sizes of images in CSS
* You can control the size of an image using the width and height properties in CSS, just like you can for any other box.


#### Aligning images using CSS
* using the float property.


#### Centering images Using CSS 
* By default, images are inline elements. This means that they flow within the surrounding text. In order to center an image, it should be turned into a blocklevel element using the display property with a value of block.


#### Background Images
* we use for it (background-img)
* The background-image property allows you to place an image behind any HTML element. This could be the entire page or just part of the page. By default, a background image will repeat to fill the entire box.


#### Repeating Images
* background-repeat:
1. repeat The background image is repeated both horizontally and vertically (the default way it is shown if the backgroundrepeat property isn't used).
2. repeat-x The image is repeated horizontally only (as shown in the first example on the left).
3. repeat-y The image is repeated verticaly only.
4. no-repeatThe image is only shown once.
* background-attachment:
1. fixed The background image stays in the same position on the page.
2. scroll The background image moves up and down as the user scrolls up and down the page.


#### background position
* we use for it (background-position).


#### shorthand 
* The background property acts like a shorthand for all of the other background properties you have just seen, and also the background-color property.


#### Image Rollovers & Sprites
* Using CSS, it is possible to create a link or button that changes to a second style when a user moves their mouse over it (known as a rollover) and a third style when they click on it.


#### CSS3: gradients
* CSS3 is going to introduce the ability to specify a gradient for the background of a box. The gradient is created using the background-image property and, at the time of writing, different browsers required a different syntax.


#### Contrast of background images 
* If you want to overlay text on a background image, the image must be low contrast in order for the text to be legible.
1. high contrast
2. low contrast
3. screen
