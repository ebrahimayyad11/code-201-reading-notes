## Dynamic Routs

### Page Path Depends on External Data
* We can pre-render pages with paths that depends on external data

### How to Statically Generate Pages with Dynamic Routes
* We want each post to have the path /posts/<id>, where <id> is the name of the markdown file under the top-level posts directory.
* Since we have ssg-ssr.md and pre-rendering.md, we’d like the paths to be /posts/ssg-ssr and /posts/pre-rendering.

### Implement getStaticPaths
* Create a file called [id].js inside the pages/posts directory.
* Also, remove first-post.js inside the pages/posts directory — we’ll no longer use this.
* paths contains the array of known paths returned by getAllPostIds(), which include the params defined by pages/posts/[id].js. Learn more in the paths key documentation
* Ignore fallback: false for now — we’ll explain that later.

### Implement getStaticProps
* We need to fetch necessary data to render the post with the given id.


### Render Markdown
* To render markdown content, we’ll use the remark library.


### Polishing the Post Page

#### Adding title to the Post Page
* In pages/posts/[id].js, let’s add the title tag using the post data. You'll need to add an import for next/head at the top of the file and add the title tag by updating the Post component.

#### Formatting the Date
* To format the date, we’ll use the date-fns library


### Adding CSS
* Finally, let’s add some CSS using the file styles/utils.module.css we added before. Open pages/posts/[id].js, then add an import for the CSS file


### Polishing the Index Page
*  let’s update our index page (pages/index.js). We need to add links to each post page using the Link component.


### Dynamic Routes Details

#### Fetch External API or Query Database
* Like getStaticProps, getStaticPaths can fetch data from any data source. In our example, getAllPostIds (which is used by getStaticPaths) may fetch from an external API endpoint


### Development v.s. Production
* In development (npm run dev or yarn dev), getStaticPaths runs on every request.
* In production, getStaticPaths runs at build time.


## Deployment


### Download Starter Code (Optional)
* If you’re NOT continuing from the previous lesson, you can download, install, and run the starter code for this lesson below. This sets up a nextjs-blog directory such that it’s identical to the result of the previous lesson.


### Push to GitHub
* Before we deploy, let’s push our Next.js app to GitHub if you haven’t done so already. This will make deployment easier.

1. On your personal GitHub account, create a new repository called nextjs-blog.
2. The repository can be public or private. You do not need to initialize it with a README or other files.
3. If you need help setting up your repo, take a look at this guide on GitHub.
4. If you haven’t initialized the git repository locally for your Next.js app, do so now.
5. Push the Next.js app to your GitHub repository.


### Deploy to Vercel
* The easiest way to deploy Next.js to production is to use the Vercel platform developed by the creators of Next.js.
* Vercel is a serverless platform for static and hybrid applications built to integrate with your headless content, commerce, or database. We make it easy for frontend teams to develop, preview, and ship delightful user experiences, where performance is the default. You can start using it for free — no credit card required.


### Create a Vercel Account
* First, go to https://vercel.com/signup to create a Vercel account. Choose Continue with GitHub and go through the sign up process.


### Import your nextjs-blog repository
* Once you’re signed up, import your nextjs-blog repository on Vercel. You can do so from here: https://vercel.com/import/git.
1. You’ll need to Install Vercel for GitHub. You can give it access to All Repositories.
2. Once you’ve installed Vercel, import nextjs-blog.


### Next.js and Vercel
* Vercel is made by the creators of Next.js and has first-class support for Next.js. When you deploy your Next.js app to Vercel, the following happens by default:
1. Pages that use Static Generation and assets (JS, CSS, images, fonts, etc) will automatically be served from the Vercel Edge Network, which is blazingly fast.
2. Pages that use Server-Side Rendering and API routes will automatically become isolated Serverless Functions. This allows page rendering and API requests to scale infinitely.


#### Vercel has many more features, such as:

* Custom Domains: Once deployed on Vercel, you can assign a custom domain to your Next.js app. Take a look at our documentation here.
* Environment Variables: You can also set environment variables on Vercel. Take a look at our documentation here. You can then use those environment variables in your Next.js app.
* Automatic HTTPS: HTTPS is enabled by default (including custom domains) and doesn't require extra configuration. We auto-renew SSL certificates.


#### Develop, Preview, Ship
* We’ve just gone through the workflow we call DPS: Develop, Preview, and Ship.

1. Develop: We’ve written code in Next.js and used the Next.js development server running to take advantage of its hot reloading feature.
2. Preview: We’ve pushed changes to a branch on GitHub, and Vercel created a preview deployment that’s available via a URL. We can share this preview URL with others for feedback. In addition to doing code reviews, you can do deployment previews.
3. Ship: We’ve merged the pull request to main to ship to production.


### Other Hosting Options
* Next.js can be deployed to any hosting provider that supports Node.js.


### Share Your Next.js App
* We encourage you to share the app you built in this tutorial on Twitter. If you do, please mention our team at @vercel so that we can take a look! We’d love to get your feedback on this tutorial as well.

### Use TypeScript with Next.js
* If you prefer using TypeScript, you can learn how to use TypeScript with Next.js from here.


### What to Learn Next
* Take a look at our documentation to learn more. In particular, the following pages might be interesting:

1. Data Fetching: Learn in depth about data fetching.
2. Environment Variables: Learn more about the built-in support for Environment Variables.
3. AMP Support: Next.js lets you easily create an AMP page.
