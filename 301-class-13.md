# Summarizing

## Sending Form Data

### Client/server architecture
  - At it's most basic, the web uses a client/server architecture that can be summarized as follows. 
  - a client (usually a web browser) sends a request to a server (most of the time a web server like Apache, Nginx, IIS, Tomcat, etc.), using the HTTP protocol. 
  - The server answers the request using the same protocol.

### On the client side: defining how to send the data
  - The `<form>` element defines how the data will be sent. All of its attributes are designed to let you configure the request to be sent when a user hits a submit button.
  -  The two most important **attributes** are `action` and `method`.

### your form data will be shown as follows in the Chrome Network tab. After submitting the form:
  - 1. Open the developer tools.
  - 2. Select "Network"
  - 3. Select "All"
  - 4. Select "foo.com" in the "Name" tab
  - 5. Select "Headers"

### If you want to send files, you need to take three extra steps:
  - Set the method attribute to POST because file content can't be put inside URL parameters.
  - Set the value of enctype to multipart/form-data because the data will be split into multiple parts, one for each file plus one for the text data included in the form body (if text is also entered into the form).
  - Include one or more <input type="file"> controls to allow your users to select the file(s) that will be uploaded.
