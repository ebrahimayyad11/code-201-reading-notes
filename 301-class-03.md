# Summarizing

## MUSTACHE 
* Mustache is a logic-less template syntax. It can be used for HTML, config files, source code — anything. It works by expanding tags in a template using values provided in a hash or object.

### Javascript Templating
* Javascript templating is a fast and efficient technique to render client-side view templates with Javascript by using a JSON data source. The template is HTML markup, with added templating tags that will either insert variables or run programming logic.


### Mustache-Express
* If you intend you use mustache with Node and Express, you can use mustache-express.


## flexbox


### Flexbox properties
* display: This defines a flex container; inline or block depending on the given value. It enables a flex context for all its direct children.
* flex-direction: This establishes the main-axis, thus defining the direction flex items are placed in the flex container. 
* flex-wrap: By default, flex items will all try to fit onto one line. You can change that and allow the items to wrap as needed with this property.
* flex-flow: This is a shorthand for the flex-direction and flex-wrap properties, which together define the flex container’s main and cross axes. The default value is row nowrap.
* justify-content: 
1. flex-start
2. flex-end
3. center
4. space-between
5. space-around
6. space-evenly
* align-items:
1. flex-start
2. flex-end
3. center
4. stretch
5. baseline
* align-content:
1. flex-start
2. flex-end
3. center
4. stretch
5. space-between
6. space-around
* order: By default, flex items are laid out in the source order. However, the order property controls the order in which they appear in the flex container.
* flex-grow: This defines the ability for a flex item to grow if necessary. It accepts a unitless value that serves as a proportion. It dictates what amount of the available space inside the flex container the item should take up.
* flex-shrink:This defines the ability for a flex item to shrink if necessary.
* flex-basis: This defines the default size of an element before the remaining space is distributed. It can be a length (e.g. 20%, 5rem, etc.) or a keyword. The auto keyword means “look at my width or height property” (which was temporarily done by the main-size keyword until deprecated).
* flex: This is the shorthand for flex-grow, flex-shrink and flex-basis combined. The second and third parameters (flex-shrink and flex-basis) are optional. 
* align-flex: This allows the default alignment (or the one specified by align-items) to be overridden for individual flex items.
