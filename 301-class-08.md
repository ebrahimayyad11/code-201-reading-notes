## SQLBOLT

Here is what i learned about SQL.

```
SELECT DISTINCT column
FROM mytable
    WHERE x < y
    ORDER BY column ASC/DESC
    LIMIT count OFFSET COUNT;
```
This is a quick way of formating a SQL query to find things within a table.

1. FROM and JOINs
The FROM clause, and subsequent JOINs are first executed to determine the total working set of data that is being queried. This includes subqueries in this clause, and can cause temporary tables to be created under the hood containing all the columns and rows of the tables being joined.

2. WHERE
Once we have the total working set of data, the first-pass WHERE constraints are applied to the individual rows, and rows that do not satisfy the constraint are discarded. Each of the constraints can only access columns directly from the tables requested in the FROM clause. Aliases in the SELECT part of the query are not accessible in most databases since they may include expressions dependent on parts of the query that have not yet executed.

3. GROUP BY
The remaining rows after the WHERE constraints are applied are then grouped based on common values in the column specified in the GROUP BY clause. As a result of the grouping, there will only be as many rows as there are unique values in that column. Implicitly, this means that you should only need to use this when you have aggregate functions in your query.

4. HAVING
If the query has a GROUP BY clause, then the constraints in the HAVING clause are then applied to the grouped rows, discard the grouped rows that don't satisfy the constraint. Like the WHERE clause, aliases are also not accessible from this step in most databases.

5. SELECT
Any expressions in the SELECT part of the query are finally computed.

6. DISTINCT
Of the remaining rows, rows with duplicate values in the column marked as DISTINCT will be discarded.

7. ORDER BY
If an order is specified by the ORDER BY clause, the rows are then sorted by the specified data in either ascending or descending order. Since all the expressions in the SELECT part of the query have been computed, you can reference aliases in this clause.

8. LIMIT / OFFSET
Finally, the rows that fall outside the range specified by the LIMIT and OFFSET are discarded, leaving the final set of rows to be returned from the query.

### Insert:

You can use the insert into to add data into a table.

```
INSERT INTO my_table VALUES (value, secondValue, thirdValue);
Now these values will be pushed into the table.
```

### Update the rows:

This is how you do it:

```
UPDATE mytable
SET column = value_or_expr, 
    other_column = another_value_or_expr, 
    …
WHERE condition;
```

Basically you say update the table, set a specific column to equal a new thing, seperate multiple ones with a comma, then tell it WHERE you want it to update.

### Let's delete some rows!

```
DELETE FROM mytable
WHERE condition;
```

You say you're deleting from a specific table and then in the where you say from which column and which condition it must meet.

### Creating a table

```
CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS mytable (
    column DataType TableConstraint DEFAULT default_value,
    another_column DataType TableConstraint DEFAULT default_value,
    …
);
```

You're telling SQL to create a table if it doesnt exist already.

It's important to tell SQL what kind of data type each column is:

Data type	Description
- INTEGER, BOOLEAN	The integer datatypes can store whole integer values like the count of a number or an age. In some implementations, the boolean value is just represented as an integer value of just 0 or 1.
- FLOAT, DOUBLE, REAL	The floating point datatypes can store more precise numerical data like measurements or fractional values. Different types can be used depending on the floating point precision required for that value.
- CHARACTER(num_chars), VARCHAR(num_chars), TEXT	
The text based datatypes can store strings and text in all sorts of locales. The distinction between the various types generally amount to underlaying efficiency of the database when working with these columns.

>Both the CHARACTER and VARCHAR (variable character) types are specified with the max number of characters that they can store (longer values may be truncated), so can be more efficient to store and query with big tables.

- DATE, DATETIME	SQL can also store date and time stamps to keep track of time series and event data. They can be tricky to work with especially when manipulating data across timezones.
- BLOB	Finally, SQL can store binary data in blobs right in the database. These values are often opaque to the database, so you usually have to store them with the right metadata to requery them.

```
Here is the material's example:
CREATE TABLE movies (
    id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY,
    title TEXT,
    director TEXT,
    year INTEGER, 
    length_minutes INTEGER
);
```

### Altering Table

```
Altering table to add new column(s)
ALTER TABLE mytable
ADD column DataType OptionalTableConstraint 
    DEFAULT default_value;

//How to remove a column:
ALTER TABLE mytable
DROP column_to_be_deleted;

// altering a table name
ALTER TABLE mytable
RENAME TO new_table_name;
```
### Dropping tables

```
Dropping tables
DROP TABLE IF EXISTS mytable;
```
