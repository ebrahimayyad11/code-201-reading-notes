## Reading and Writing Files in Python

### What Is a File?
* At its core, a file is a contiguous set of bytes used to store data. This data is organized in a specific format and can be anything as simple as a text file or as complicated as a program executable. In the end, these byte files are then translated into binary 1 and 0 for easier processing by the computer.
* Files on most modern file systems are composed of three main parts:
1. **Header:** metadata about the contents of the file (file name, size, type, and so on)
2. **Data:** contents of the file as written by the creator or editor
3. **End of file (EOF):** special character that indicates the end of the file


### File Paths
* When you access a file on an operating system, a file path is required. The file path is a string that represents the location of a file. It’s broken up into three major parts:
1. **Folder Path:** the file folder location on the file system where subsequent folders are separated by a forward slash / (Unix) or backslash \ (Windows)
2. **File Name:** the actual name of the file
3. **Extension:** the end of the file path pre-pended with a period (.) used to indicate the file type


### Line Endings
* One problem often encountered when working with file data is the representation of a new line or line ending. The line ending has its roots from back in the Morse Code era, when a specific pro-sign was used to communicate the end of a transmission or the end of a line.
* Later, this was standardized for teleprinters by both the International Organization for Standardization (ISO) and the American Standards Association (ASA). ASA standard states that line endings should use the sequence of the Carriage Return (CR or \r) and the Line Feed (LF or \n) characters (CR+LF or \r\n). The ISO standard however allowed for either the CR+LF characters or just the LF character.


### Character Encodings
* Another common problem that you may face is the encoding of the byte data. An encoding is a translation from byte data to human readable characters. This is typically done by assigning a numerical value to represent a character. The two most common encodings are the ASCII and UNICODE Formats. ASCII can only store 128 characters, while Unicode can contain up to 1,114,112 characters.
* ASCII is actually a subset of Unicode (UTF-8), meaning that ASCII and Unicode share the same numerical to character values. It’s important to note that parsing a file with the incorrect character encoding can lead to failures or misrepresentation of the character. For example, if a file was created using the UTF-8 encoding, and you try to parse it using the ASCII encoding, if there is a character that is outside of those 128 values, then an error will be thrown.


### Opening and Closing a File in Python
* When you want to work with a file, the first thing to do is to open it. This is done by invoking the open() built-in function. open() has a single required argument that is the path to the file. open() has a single return, the file object:
* file = open('dog_breeds.txt') 


|**Character**|**Meaning**|
|-------------|-----------|
| 'r' | open for reading(Default)|
| 'w' | Open for writing, truncating (overwriting) the file first |
| 'rb' or 'wb' | Open in binary mode (read/write using byte data) |


### There are three different categories of file objects:
1. Text files
2. Buffered binary files
3. Raw binary files


### Reading and Writing Opened Files
* Once you’ve opened up a file, you’ll want to read or write to the file. First off, let’s cover reading a file. There are multiple methods that can be called on a file object to help you out:

|**Method**|**What it does**|
|----------|----------------|
|[.read(size=-1)](https://docs.python.org/3.7/library/io.html#io.RawIOBase.read)|This reads from the file based on the number of size bytes. If no argument is passed or None or -1 is passed, then the entire file is read.|
|[.readline(size=-1)](https://docs.python.org/3.7/library/io.html#io.IOBase.readline)|This reads at most size number of characters from the line. This continues to the end of the line and then wraps back around. If no argument is passed or None or -1 is passed, then the entire line (or rest of the line) is read.|
|[.readlines()](https://docs.python.org/3.7/library/io.html#io.IOBase.readlines)|This reads the remaining lines from the file object and returns them as a list.|


### Iterating Over Each Line in the File
*  As with reading files, file objects have multiple methods that are useful for writing to a file:

|**Method**|**What it does**|
|----------|----------------|
|.write(string)|This writes the string to the file.|
|.writelines(seq)|This writes the sequence to the file. No line endings are appended to each sequence item. It’s up to you to add the appropriate line ending(s).|


### Working With Bytes
* Sometimes, you may need to work with files using byte strings. This is done by adding the 'b' character to the mode argument.
* You can actually open that file in Python and examine the contents! Since the .png file format is well defined, the header of the file is 8 bytes broken up like this:

|**Value**|**Interpretation**|
|----------|----------------|
|0x89|A “magic” number to indicate that this is the start of a PNG|
|0x50 0x4E 0x47|PNG in ASCII|
|0x0D 0x0A|A DOS style line ending \r\n|
|0x1A|A DOS style EOF character|
|0x0A|A Unix style line ending \n|


### Creating Your Own Context Manager
* There may come a time when you’ll need finer control of the file object by placing it inside a custom class. When you do this, using the with statement can no longer be used unless you add a few magic methods: __enter__ and __exit__. By adding these, you’ll have created what’s called a [context manager](https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#typecontextmanager).



## Python Exceptions: An Introduction


### Exceptions versus Syntax Errors
* Syntax errors occur when the parser detects an incorrect statement. Observe the following example:
```
>>> print( 0 / 0 ))
  File "<stdin>", line 1
    print( 0 / 0 ))
                  ^
SyntaxError: invalid syntax
```
* The arrow indicates where the parser ran into the syntax error.


### Raising an Exception
* We can use raise to throw an exception if a condition occurs. The statement can be complemented with a custom exception.
* If you want to throw an error when a certain condition occurs using raise, you could go about it like this:
```
x = 10
if x > 5:
    raise Exception('x should not exceed 5. The value of x was: {}'.format(x))
``` 
* When you run this code, the output will be the following:
```
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "<input>", line 4, in <module>
Exception: x should not exceed 5. The value of x was: 10
```


### The AssertionError Exception
* Instead of waiting for a program to crash midway, you can also start by [making an assertion in Python](https://dbader.org/blog/python-assert-tutorial). We assert that a certain condition is met. If this condition turns out to be True, then that is excellent! The program can continue. If the condition turns out to be False, you can have the program throw an AssertionError exception.
* Have a look at the following example, where it is asserted that the code will be executed on a Linux system:
```
import sys
assert ('linux' in sys.platform), "This code runs on Linux only."
```


### The try and except Block: Handling Exceptions
* The try and except block in Python is used to catch and handle exceptions. Python executes code following the try statement as a “normal” part of the program. The code that follows the except statement is the program’s response to any exceptions in the preceding try clause.
* The following function can help you understand the try and except block:
```
def linux_interaction():
    assert ('linux' in sys.platform), "Function can only run on Linux systems."
    print('Doing something.')
```

### The else Clause
* In Python, using the else statement, you can instruct a program to execute a certain block of code only in the absence of exceptions.
* Look at the following example:
```
try:
    linux_interaction()
except AssertionError as error:
    print(error)
else:
    print('Executing the else clause.')
```


### Cleaning Up After Using finally
* Imagine that you always had to implement some sort of action to clean up after executing your code. Python enables you to do so using the finally clause.
* Have a look at the following example:
```
try:
    linux_interaction()
except AssertionError as error:
    print(error)
else:
    try:
        with open('file.log') as file:
            read_data = file.read()
    except FileNotFoundError as fnf_error:
        print(fnf_error)
finally:
    print('Cleaning up, irrespective of any exceptions.')
```
